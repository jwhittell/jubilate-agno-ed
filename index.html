        <p>Christopher Smart wrote <em> Jubilate Agno </em> during what he called his “jeopardy,” a six-year confinement in St. Luke’s asylum from 1757-1763, but the work remained unpublished until W.F. Stead released a copy under the title <em> Rejoice in the Lamb: A Song from Bedlam </em> in 1939. After its publication, <em> Jubilate Agno </em> was popularized by twentieth-century experimental poets and literary scholars; it is now one of the few works by Smart consistently taken up by the academy. Because recent copies of the text are out of print, and a scholarly edition is lacking, this online edition provides a robust digital access point for academic and casual readers alike. </p>
